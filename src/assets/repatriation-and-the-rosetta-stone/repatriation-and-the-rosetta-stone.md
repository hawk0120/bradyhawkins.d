# Repatriation and the Value of the Rosetta Stone

Repatriation is a stain leftover from a less civilized time. Many western museums house stolen or looted artifacts from their colonial empires. The British Museum is no exception to that. It houses countless “gifted” items. One of these is a magnificent slab of stone with three different written languages on it. It was the key to decoding hieroglyphs, opening up the ancient Egyptian world. It’s probably the right course of action to give it back. However, it is complicated legally. The British Museum is bound by British law to maintain and retain the items.

 “Parliament passed legislation binding the Board of Trustees to abide by certain principles, including preserving the collection and prohibiting the disposal of objects, except in very few circumstances. As such, the Museum is administrated through trust and fiduciary duty law, legally binding the Trustees to preserve the Museum’s collection. This paper argues that, despite pressing demands for the Museum to repatriate cultural property, the Board of Trustees is prohibited from repatriation.”

 This brings up the question if Egypt wanted to buy the stone back, what would the nation have to pay on the open market? Or more specifically, what is the market value of the Rosetta Stone? The real answer is “priceless”. There is some dispute about the legislation and it could change. But, I highly doubt that given the state of UK politics. Lol Lettuce not say more.

To their credit, the British Museum didn’t steal it from an indigenous group. They won it after defeating the French in Egypt. It was during the Napoleonic Era. Napolean had launched a campaign into Egypt, French Officer Pierre-Francois Bouchard uncovered the stone on the banks of the Nile. Pierre-Francois had the foresight to recognize what it was. At the time, Ancient Greek was known so linguists got to work and decyphered the languages. It fell into the hands of the British when Napolean was defeated. Immediately the British moved it to the British Museum, where its been on display since 1802. It’s now believed to be from the Hellenistic era and culturally recognized as the item that opened ancient Egypt.

Let's forego the legislation and state that it can be sold regardless of its legal status. We’ll use two different methods of evaluation. The first is comparables, is there any artifacts that I can compare with it? The next method would be if a random Uber-Billionaire wanted to own it, what would they have to pay to acquire it? I thought to use a cash flow model, but the British Museum doesn’t publicly provide reliable data.

The Rosetta Stone is a unique 1-of-1 item. It wasn’t always this way, the Singapore Stone would have been a perfect comparable but it was unfortunately destroyed by the British in 1843 to clear space for a fort. I’m noticing a theme here. Let's try to stay with this theme: items that could be repatriated.

There are 2 notable instances of someone auctioning a potentially repatriated item. The instances are:

---

Benin Bronze Head - The Benin Bronze Head is an item separated from the rest of the Benin Bronze collection(also housed at the British Museum). It was sold in 2020 for USD$ 5.38 million. That’s USD$ 6.16 million adjusted for inflation. 

Greywacke Statue Tribute to Isis - The statue was sold in a British auction in 2012 for £3.25 million. Adjusted for the currency exchange and inflation, that’s USD$ 6.46million today. Assuming that the currency changed in 2012 and not in recent weeks.

Valuation: USD$ 6.16m to USD$ 6.46m

I told a friend that I was writing this. Besides laughing at my attempt, he asked “isn’t it worth what someone is willing to pay for it?”. He’s right.

What if an extremely wealthy person wanted to purchase it on behalf of Egypt? Forbes lists 6 Egyptian billionaires, all having the capacity to purchase. When it comes to billionaires, there are countless examples of pissing matches getting out of control. There are only so many of these trophy assets in existence. Yachts, jets, and sports teams are all commonplace in uber-wealthy portfolios. One asset class draws a similar comparison, real estate. It benefits from the value of time and can grow into a place in culture.

A great example is any property from the British Monarchy’s large real estate portfolio. Let us select Buckingham palace. According to a study completed by McCarthy Stone, Buckingham Palace is worth £1.3billion in 2022(USD$ 1.46b). The Dumfries House, another estate of the British royal family was sold at £45 million (USD$ 91.69m) in 2007. Considering the Denver Broncos sold this summer for 2.02x the previous record for a sports franchise, it’s safe to warrant that the purchase price would be much more.  

Valuation: USD$ 91.96 million - USD$ 2.92 billion

After researching, I stumbled on the topic of heritage asset valuation. The UK Government has released some documents on it but ultimately fell short of a reliable quantitative methodology. Arriving at a reliable valuation that can be tested by audit is at least problematic and, in some cases, impossible. It is impossibly complex and most don’t bother trying.

So under these methods, the Rosetta Stone is worth somewhere between USD$ 6.16million and USD$ 2.96billion. I personally would place it between USD$ 90million and USD$ 500million, given the cultural relevance and comparability. I realize putting a number on ancient artifacts can seem quite cold-blooded. This is all hypothetical. 

Alternatively, the Egyptian government pull a reversal, colonize the UK, and claim it as plunder.

TL;DR

The Rosetta Stone is worth a LOT of money and the British Museum would be empty without colonization.
