**A Per Capita Perspective on Digital Trade Exports**  

I recently came across this post on digital trade exports.

While I was not surprised to see some the of the countries listed, some peaked my interest. I found interesting that there seems to be a bifurcation of countries that export digital goods. The tradition large economies and the small specialized economies. If we assume the absolute numbers of a country, places like the U.S., China, and India dominate global rankings with billions of dollars in exports. But when we look at these figures per capita? The results paint a completely different picture. I ran these numbers to look a bit closer.  

Using 2020 data, Luxembourg emerges as the clear leader in digital trade exports per capita at an astonishing $193,650. That's staggering. This is due to its small population and status as a global hub for financial and digital services. Ireland, another small economy, follows with $65,600 per capita, using its tax haven status.  

Singapore ($31,930) and Switzerland ($12,907) round out the top tier, showcasing the outsized impact smaller, high-tech economies.  

Larger countries like the U.S. ($1,961) and China ($148), while dominating total exports, drop significantly in per capita rankings. Their large populations dilute the impact of large export figures.  

Here's a look at some notable per capita figures:  
- Luxembourg: $193,650  
- Ireland: $65,600  
- Singapore: $31,930  
- Switzerland: $12,907  
- Netherlands: $11,412  
- UK: $6,441  

Countries like India ($186) and China ($148) remain at the bottom of the per capita rankings, even as they rise globally in absolute terms.  

This per capita lens highlights how smaller, innovation-driven economies can outperform larger nations in terms of economic output relative to their population. It also reveals a different side to global trade dynamics, where quality and focus often trump wuantity.  

I want to add that on a per capita basis, my home country of Canada out paces the USA. Tell that to the guy who is calling Canada the 51st state.
